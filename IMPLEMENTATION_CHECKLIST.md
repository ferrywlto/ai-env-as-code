# Implementation Checklist

## v0.8 — Explicit repository-aware initialization

- [x] Require `--repo` for `init`; remove positional/default-directory semantics.
- [x] Define `aec help` and the missing-`--repo` diagnostic.
- [x] Define absolute repository and ChatGPT paths for managed instructions.
- [x] Authorize direct `dotnet run` migration and a local-only data commit.
- [x] Add focused failing CLI and managed-block tests.
- [x] Implement repository-aware block version migration.
- [x] Update the `$aec` skill, CLI version, and documentation.
- [x] Pass skill, Debug, and Release validation.
- [ ] Commit and push the exact v0.8 engine paths.
- [ ] Create the initial `aec-data` commit, apply, and verify.

## v0.7 — Install the AEC skill during initialization

- [x] Confirm ordinary `aec init` is the initial skill-installation point.
- [x] Defer executable publishing and future skill upgrades.
- [x] Capture the user-authored `$aec` behavioral contract.
- [x] Scaffold and validate the minimal `aec` skill.
- [x] Add failing installation and containment tests.
- [x] Install skill metadata during ordinary `init`.
- [x] Keep `init --provider=chatgpt` repository-only.
- [x] Update version and user documentation.
- [x] Pass Debug and Release verification.
- [x] Prepare the exact engine release paths and staged secret gate.
- [x] Complete the source-first AEC validation and canonical commit/push.

## Immediate next work

Commit and push the validated v0.8 engine before the approved data migration.
